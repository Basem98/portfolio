                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Basem Mostafa, and I want to do
                    <a class="story-anch" href="#something">something</a>...
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Egyptian <span>Full-stack Web Developer</span>,
                    but a dedicated, passionate <span>Programmer</span> and a <span>Computer Science enthusiast</span>
                    in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can deal with the back end (currently using <span>Node.js</span>, but open to using any other
                    language, or
                    run-time environment in Node's case),
                    as well as with the front end (fluent in <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>HTML</span>,
                    <span>CSS</span>, and would 100% learn any other
                    tool, framework or library to get the job done).
                    As long as what I'm assigned is a development-related task, I'm up for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting titles aside, I love computers and solving problems more than anything else.
                    They're what I indulge myself in for the bigger portion of my time, either professional or free.
                    Hence, my love for Programming and Computer Science. It's where these two things meet at a
                    crossroad.
                </p>

                                    <li>&#8226; <span>Heroku</span> as the cloud PaaS, on which the entire project is hosted</li>

                                The Czech-English Word Game is one of the projects, 
                                in which I've tried to combine my knowledge in linguistics (my university major) with development (my profession and my hobby).
                                As a bilingual, going through the process of learning a language was a hard challenge.
                                I've always tried to use as many tools and apps as possible to keep my language skills sharp,
                                and to do so vocabulary is one of the most important aspects in such a process.
                                Hence, the bulding of the Czech-English Word Game. It's a place for both, Czech and English learners, 
                                to practice their vocabulary in either language, along with a competitive touch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this project, I tried tackling as many integral and must-have back-end functionalities as I could.
                                From <span>password encryption</span>, <span>email verification</span>, <span>data validation</span>,
                                <span>session-based authentication</span> to <span>admin authentication</span>. 
                                I practiced and implemented by myself all of these into this project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, remember when I said, "along with a competitive touch"? I implemented some sort of a leveling or a titling system. 
                                It's explained in detail on the website's about page. While also there's a "Top 5" side bar that has a prominent list of the top 5 players.

                                The UI was made using the following tools:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&#8226; Vanilla <span>HTML5</span> and <span>CSS3</span> for the layout</li>

                                    <li>&#8226; <span>Netlify</span> as the cloud hosting service</li>
                                </ul>

                                This is a landing page that could represent any data that comes from a news API or any CMS. 
                                The whole purpose of the project is to add various animations and go through real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM 
                                and making web pages dynamic using only vanilla JavaScript along with HTML5 and CSS3.

                                    <li>&#8226; Dynamically build a navigation bar when the DOM is ready and add links to it based on the number of sections</li>

                                    <li>&#8226; Make clicking the anchor tags scroll to the sections, instead of the default behavior</li>
                                    <li>&#8226; Add an active state to the navigation items when their associated sections are active as well</li>
                                    <li>&#8226; Hide the navigation bar after 5 3 seconds of inactivity</li>
                                    <li>&#8226; Add a scroll to the top button that appears when you get past the fold of the page</li>

                                Livechat is an experiment that I've had to practice using Socket.io 
                                to create a minimalistic real-time chatting application. 
                                Due to the experiment being local only, I had to use two browsers, 
                                in order to mimic a conversation between two parties on different ends.

                                Timesheet was my first attempt to actually use my development and overall programming skills 
                                to solve day-to-day real-life problems. This task-calculating app was a very helpful tool 
                                that I made when I was working as an Internet Assessor. When the assessment tasks numbers grew, it was 
                                confusing and hard to keep count of the type of each individual task, the average estimated time taken to finish it
                                and the date of the task. Moreover, it was even harder to keep track of weekly and monthly counts by yourself.
                                Thus, the Timesheet calculator idea occurred to me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used Timesheet locally for reasons that go back to the contract with the company I worked for, but 
                                it's totally easy and hassle-free to deploy it somewhere and make it live. Timesheet was one of the first 
                                times when I was hit in the face by an epiphany, which made me realize the power of programming. 
                                No matter how hard a task is, as long as it's computable, 
                                you can figure out a way to tell the computer how to do it for you, 
                                achieving what <span>J. C. R. Licklider</span> once envisioned, which is a future where computers will 
                                set humans free from the burden of having to carry out any time-consuming and boring daily routine tasks 
                                that could be easily carried out by a computer, leaving more room for humans to dedicate for more creative tasks.

                                    <li>&#8226; <span>C</span> as the programming language for the entire project</li>
                                    <li>&#8226; <span>Allegro 5</span> as the library to handle the lower-level tasks in game development</li>
                                    <li>&#8226; <span>Valgrind</span>, <span>AddressSanitizer</span> and <span>GDB</span> for the debugging</li>

                                Remember the game Blasteroids from the 80s and early 90s? 
                                This is essentially a more basic version of it, 
                                which was built using only lines to draw everything on a 2D plane.

                                The purpose behind this project is completely educational. 
                                I finished reading Head First C as my introduction to C, 
                                then I decided that building a game without using a game framework for the 2D transformations 
                                or the collision detection would be a perfect step to pick up the Linear Algebra skills needed to solve these problems, 
                                and of course the necessary C skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I obviously used <span>Allegro 5</span> to handle the lower-lever graphic problems, 
                                as well as handling the event queue and listener. 
                                However, everything else in the game is written by me and implemented by me. 
                                This project, though not completed, has taught me a lot of very valuable skills as a programmer in general, 
                                such as <span>Memory Management</span>, <span>Main Loops (The heart of every interactive program)</span>, 
                                <span>2D Transformations</span> in computational graphics 
                                as well as the necessary debugging skills to debug syntax, runtime, logic and behavourial errors 
                                using important C tools (mainly Valgrind, AddressSanitizer and GDB).
